# packages/shared Agents

## Purpose

- This workspace is currently a placeholder for shared CLI utilities or reusable React/Expo logic. No source files exist yet, but the structure keeps the workspace ready for future shared modules.

## Commands

- Run `bun run -F shared build` from the root to exercise any shared build steps once they are implemented.
- Because the workspace is empty today, focus on keeping the global workspace scripts (format, lint, typecheck) green when introducing shared code.

## Notes

- Link any new shared logic here to the Expo app (or new CLI helpers) as the workspace matures. Keep this file updated once source files are added.
