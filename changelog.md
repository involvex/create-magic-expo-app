# (2026-02-19)

## Documentation & experience

- Added a GH Pages docs site with modern layout, sticky navigation, responsive hero, and dynamic changelog sourcing for instant context.
- Highlighted the `Plan.md` roadmap, security references, and `.github/FUNDING.yml` support links across the README and docs for cleaner onboarding.

## Automation & safety

- Added Dependabot configuration plus a `security` workflow that runs `bun audit`, linting, type checking, and Expo build checks on every push to `main`.
- Documented the Claude/Copilot hooks and the new `Security.md` guidance so each task completes with format/lint/typecheck/build validation.
